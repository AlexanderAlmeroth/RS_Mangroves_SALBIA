## Validation_2023 ##

This folder compiles all the shapefiles used for validation. These shapes have been created by various members of the researchers team and represent Ground-Truth-Sites.

For use in GEE: 
1. Import as Assests
2. Import the Assets into the script and (in case needed rename)
3. You need to convert them into editable polyongs/geometries
4. Then transfer the geometry as a layer
5. Create validation Dataset from these polygons. 

-> All this code you'll find in the GEE Script for the 2023.
